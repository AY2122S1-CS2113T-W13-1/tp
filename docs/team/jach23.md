## Overview
Hi! I'm a Year 2 NUS Computer Engineering student.

Please see below for my contributions to Traveller.

### Summary of Contributions
* WorldMap
  * Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm
  * Implementing key functionalities as conceptualised as a graph 
  * Allowing searching for the most optimal costs or time
  * Returning the path of the shortest cost or time
  * Basic exceptions and assertions
  * Creating all major test cases
  
* Item List
  * Search
  * Edit/Update

#### Features
* `shortest-time`: Allow users to find the shortest time from one destination to another.
  * Core part of Traveller, which is to enable users to find the minimal route and the corresponding path breakdown.
* `shortest-cost`: Allow users to find the least expensive distance from one destination to another.
  * Core part of Traveller, which is to help users to find the cheapest path and the corresponding journey breakdown.
* `search-item`: Allow users to search using an item keyword.
  * Usually, people plan trips by day. Using the given day and trip, this enables users to search for all items
  * containing the corresponding keyword using Traveller, without having to spend time manually checking each activity
  * one by one.
* `edit-item`: Allow users to edit existing items.
  * Based on the index of the activity and its corresponding day, the user is then able to update and edit the activity,
  * based on either time or name or both. This enables users to fix accidents like spelling errors and accommodate last
  * minute travel plan impromptu changes, without having to go through the hassle of deleting and adding the corrected
  * event again.

#### Other code contributions
* Conceptualised the basic architecture for Traveller's WorldMap Optimiser.
* Implemented its basic structure as modelled by a graph, such as MinCalcResult.
* Added exceptions, assertions, logging
* Creating major test cases for the WorldMap functionalities.

#### Project Management
* Reviewed multiple PRs.

#### Documentation
* User Guide (UG)
  * Wrote all key WorldMap sections and functions.
  * Wrote the sections corresponding to Searching and Editing of Items.

* Developer Guide (DG)
  * Created overall structure of the DG.
  * Wrote preface, Table of Contents, Design & Implementation header paragraph, World Map header paragraph,
    Main Traveller header paragraph, Traveller class, Parser class.
