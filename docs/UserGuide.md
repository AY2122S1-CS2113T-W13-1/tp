Traveller is a travel planner app that is designed to help holidaymakers like you optimise your trips!
It is created for individuals who prefer to use a Command Line Interface (CLI) over a Graphical User Interface (GUI), 
while still retaining the ease of use of a GUI.
Use Traveller so that you can plan your trips with ease and focus on what matters most: Fun!

### What is a Command Line Interface (CLI)?
A CLI is a way of interacting with applications via lines of text, instead of the usual way of clicking on the application.
Each computer will have their own CLI, such as the window's Powershell and the MacOS's Terminal.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed.
2. Down the latest version of `Traveller` from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W13-1/tp).
